# School Indoor Navigation System

A web-based indoor navigation system designed to help students, staff, and visitors easily find rooms, offices, and facilities within a school campus using interactive indoor maps.

This project focuses on **frontend-only implementation**, inspired by platforms such as **MazeMap**, and uses embedded indoor maps created with **Mappedin**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Navigating large school buildings can be difficult, especially for new students and visitors.  
This system provides a simple and intuitive web interface where users can:

- View an interactive indoor map of the school
- Search for rooms and locations
- Switch between **2D and 3D map views**
- Navigate floors visually using a modern dark-themed UI

The application runs entirely in the browser and **does not require a backend server or database**.

## Key Features

- Interactive indoor map embedded using **Mappedin**
- 2D and 3D map toggle (MazeMap-style)
- Searchable locations within the map viewer
- Dark theme UI for better usability and accessibility
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers
- Clean separation of pages (Home, Map, About)

## Methodology

The project is developed using the **Agile methodology** with the **Scrum framework**.

- Work is divided into **Sprints**
- **Milestones** are used to represent sprint goals
- A **Scrum Board** is maintained to track:
  - Product Backlog
  - Sprint Backlog
  - Completed Tasks

Issues are classified as:

- **Issues 1–9** → Functional requirements (what the system does)
- **Issues 10–14** → Technical implementation (how the system is built)
